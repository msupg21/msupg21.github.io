  <h1>Some discussion on an array of topics</h1>
  <h3><strong>What is the difference between switch and
    if/else? When would you use one versus the other?</strong></h3>
    <p>The switch case can be more compact and allows the user to decide which case
      to be excuted.  They are easy to edit because the syntax is minimal.
      <br><br>
      With if/else statements, there is more room for complexity.  Unlike switch
      statements, if/else statements can have multiple choice of expressions instead
      of having only on expression multiple choices.
      <br><br>I would use if and else when dealing with any type of user input that
      would have a multiple variations of similar data.  I would use switch
      over if/else if I were trying to excute more nominal input like dates, demographics,
      and such.</p><hr>
      <h3><strong>When would you use = vs == vs .equals? Explain what each
        of these does and in which cases you should use them.</strong></h3>
        <p>So =, ==, and .equals() serve in 3 different ways with really no similar
          functions...

          <br><br>It is worth noting that each expression is dependent
          on its varibable, or type of variable rather.

          <br><br>In the case of the
          simple = sign, this can be used to assign or store a type of variable.
          Let's say you simple want to assign a int variable x (int x), you would use
          the = to assign a value to x (int x = 1). In my example the int x has a
          value of one.  The = has a purpose of assigning values to variables(String, int,
          double, boolean, etc.).

          <br><br>Now the == sign is basically saying out load "IS EQUAL TO", however, we only
          comparing references, not values.  So, something like 1 == 1
          would be true because == is checking to see if the two references are to th same object.


          <br><br>.equals() Compares values for equality. This is commonly used with String
          type variables as each value is checked character by character against
          the variable t is being crossed referenced to.  I would use the .equals()
          when dealing with password statements.  I would use a.equals(b); to compare
          the users stored password of (b) against the freshly inputed password which is
          the (a) string. If the statement is true then the passwords would match.<hr>

          <h3><strong>Int vs. Double: What are their differences?</strong></h3>
          <p>To be clear, both varibales deal with any - of + intergers.  The difference
            lies with the amount of decimals being stored, because there is a
            different amount of bytes used to store a int and a double respectively.<br><br>
            An int only uses 4 bytes and can only store whole numbers ranging from
            -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on a 32 bit system.
            <br><br>
            So one would ask, why would I need to use double when int has a range like that?
            Well the answer is because it doesnt take very long for a whole number to
            be manipulated into a fraction or a int that would not want to be rounded
            to its nearest whole number i.e 99.33 like  money.  In this case you would want to allow a double
            fraction to hold the value of this variable to allow for more precision and more
            accurate solutions for later reference.
            <br><br>A double uses 8 bytes.

            <h3><strong>What happens when you include import java.util.Scanner?<br>
            Where does it come from? </strong></h3>
            <p>Well, simply put, the java.util.Scanner is a class in the java library.
              The util.Scanner allows the system to take input to be stored through the
              use of external hardware like a keyboard.  The util.Scanner has the following
              methods: nextInt(), nextLong(), nextFloat(), nextDouble(), next(),
              nextLine().
            <br><br>
            There are two class constructors.  one takes an InputStream object as a
            parameter and the other takes a FileReader object as a parameter.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop?</h3>
            <p> A while loop statement allows to repeatedly executes a target
               statement as long as a given condition is true.
            <br><br>
            For loops allow you to efficiently write a loop that needs to excute a
            specific number of times.  Example: for(initialization; condition;increment/
            decrement) | for(int x = 1;x <=5,x++).
            <br><br>
            A do while loop looks similar to a while loop, except that a do while loop
            is guaranteed to execute at least one time which has its advantages.
